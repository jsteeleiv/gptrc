# gptrc: Simplifying Your AI Interactions

**gptrc** is a tool that saves you time by pre-configuring your AI interactions. No more repeating the same instructions or setting context with every conversation. With **gptrc**, you define your settings once, and it applies them to every AI instance you interact with.

### What It Does:

- **Pre-set Parameters**: Set up your desired settings (like tone, style, etc.) once, and **gptrc** will automatically apply them to future conversations with your AI.
    
- **Universal**: Works across different AI platforms, ensuring consistency in your interactions.
    
- **Saves Time**: Forget about retyping prompts or instructions. With **gptrc**, the AI knows exactly how you want to interact from the start.
    

### Why It’s Useful:

**gptrc** makes interacting with AI faster and easier. It eliminates the need for constant re-configuration, freeing up your time to focus on the conversation itself.

### How It Works:

1. Install **gptrc**.
2. Create a configuration file with your preferred settings.
3. Use **gptrc** whenever you interact with AI, and it will automatically apply your settings.

### What’s Next:

This tool is a Work-in-Progress (WIP), and we plan to add more features in the future.
